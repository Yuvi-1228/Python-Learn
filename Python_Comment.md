# Python Comment 
- Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
for Example: 
```
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```
# Multiline Comments
- Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
```
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
