# What is Python?
- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language used to create software, websites, apps, automation scripts, and much more. It is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages in the world.

## What we can do with Python ?
- Web Development           : Build websites using frameworks like Django, Flask
- Data Science	            : Analyze data, make charts, use machine learning (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy)
- Automation/Scripting	    : Automate boring tasks like file management, email sending
- App Development	        : Create desktop or mobile apps
- Game Development	        : Build simple games using Pygame
- Cybersecurity	            : Write tools for ethical hacking and security testing
- AI & Machine Learning	    : Build smart systems like chatbots, recommendation engines

# Why Python ?
- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

# Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
