# How to Executed 
- Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the command line or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the command line.
```
# Simple command line execute
print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```

```
# Using file extension
C:\Users\yourlaptopname> python myfile.py
```

# Pyhton Indentation
- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# Python Variables
- In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
For Example:
```
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

```
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
